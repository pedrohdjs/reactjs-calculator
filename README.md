This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple calculator written by the end of my first week of React studies.
It does not use any complex features,but it was a fun toy project to get the handle of how things work in React and also a valuable experience to improve my Javascript abilities.
